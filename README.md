## iOS specifics
**Image Picker Package**
Starting with version **0.8.1** the iOS implementation uses PHPicker to pick (multiple) images on iOS 14 or higher.
As a result of implementing PHPicker it becomes impossible to pick HEIC images on the iOS simulator in iOS 14+. This is a known issue. Please test this on a real device, or test with non-HEIC images until Apple solves this issue.[63426347 - Apple known issue](https://www.google.com/search?q=63426347+apple&sxsrf=ALeKk01YnTMid5S0PYvhL8GbgXJ40ZS[…]t=gws-wiz&ved=0ahUKEwjKh8XH_5HwAhWL_rsIHUmHDN8Q4dUDCA8&uact=5)
